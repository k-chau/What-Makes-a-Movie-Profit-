    "## Research Question\n",
    "Are there specific months for movie release dates that generate more revenue in the box office? Is there a correlation between movie budgets and their success in the box office?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "This is a question of interest because the film industry may be able to find some different strategies to maximize their revenue, such as the best time to release their new movies or determine how much their budget will correlate to potential revenue. With so many movies always coming out, we wondered if there was a correlation between box office success and release dates in conjunction with how big a movie’s budgets is. In some of our background research we found that the number of user votes on IMDB for a movie corresponds with how well-known the film is, and that critics’ reviews don’t have that much of an influence on the success of a movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "We always hear about big budget movies because they’re the ones that usually have the ability to advertise the film to the point where everyone sees it. But sometimes movies with relatively small budgets rise to the top of the the box offices. Content has something to do with it, but we want to see how much of an impact the time at which you release a movie has on the success of the film. There have been some blog posts about which genre generally gets released for each month, and there was some indication that the winter months would be when the best movies (Oscar nominated ones) come out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our question is important because it presents a visualization for the correlation between box office success and release dates in conjuction with movie budgets. We want to know if there is a strong correlation and if there is a pattern to movie release dates. It is unclear if there are popular months for movie releases or box office success. \n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "We predict that if a movie is released during July or August, then it will generate more revenue in the box office. We also predict that if a movie has a big budget, then it will generate more revenue in the box office. "
