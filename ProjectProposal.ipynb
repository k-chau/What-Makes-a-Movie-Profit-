    "This is a question of interest because the film industry may be able to find some different strategies to maximize their revenue, such as the best time to release their new movies or determine how much their budget will correlate to potential revenue. With so many movies always coming out, we wondered if there was a correlation between box office success and release dates in conjunction with how big a movie’s budgets is. In some of our background research we found that the number of user votes on IMDB for a movie corresponds with how well-known the film is, and that critics’ reviews don’t have that much of an influence on the success of a movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "We always hear about big budget movies because they’re the ones that usually have the ability to advertise the film to the point where everyone sees it. But sometimes movies with relatively small budgets rise to the top of the the box offices. Content has something to do with it, but we want to see how much of an impact the time at which you release a movie has on the success of the film. There have been some blog posts about which genre generally gets released for each month, and there was some indication that the winter months would be when the best movies (Oscar nominated ones) come out. \n",

    "Our question is important because it presents a visualization for the correlation between box office success and release dates in conjuction with movie budgets.

    "The data contains some missing values. To ‘clean’ the data, we would remove the row containing missing/empty values. For example, some values are marked as zero in the ‘revenue’ and ‘budget’ columns. Also, our project is mainly interested in movies’ gross revenue and their correlation to release date so we would drop the data columns that we are uninterested in i.e. ‘homepage’, ‘runtime’, ‘tagline’, etc.. We will use the drop function to remove the columns and rewrite the dataframe to remove the zero values in ‘budget’ and ‘revenue’. However, we will keep ‘production_countries’ column because our data may more or less so be correlated to the United States’ seasons. \n",

    "\n",
    "The method we will be implementing in our project (after completing the pre-processing) is plotting and finding correlations. First, we want to see the number of movies produced in the United States. We will sum the number of rows that hold the value of ‘United States of America’ in their ‘production_countries’ column  we will be plotting the count of the number of movies released in each month. This means we will grab the number of rows in each dataframe sorted by month and plot it on a bar graph for a visual. These values will help calculate the average revenue generated in that month. We will also generate a scatter plot to determine a correlation between ‘budget’ and ‘revenue’ for the purpose of seeing a general trend. This will be done using matplotlib and setting ‘budget’ as the x-axis and ‘revenue’ as the y-axis, or vice versa. The average revenue garnered within a month would be measured by the sum of the gross revenue generated by each movie in that month divided by the number of movies released in that month. Having that gross revenue column, we can sum the whole column and divide by the number of rows to calculate the average for each month since each dataframe will be representative of a month. Each month’s movie revenue will be plotted on a line graph, using matplotlib, to see if there is a shared correlation. This will show if movie release dates are dependent on a specific month to generate more profit.\n",

Due to inflation, the value of money may be different in each year. To address this, we may use inflation rate data to find the actual value for ‘budget’ and ‘revenue’ or trim the list to movies made in the past decade or so. There does not seem to be any other issues related to our topic area, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact.

This project will contribute that movies released in the United States will sell more tickets if sold during the summer due to breaks and holidays.

It provides more information for potential factors that can make movies sell more over the summer.\n",

If it is a different trend than what we hypothesized, we will analyze what may be special about those months and what kind of movies are generating large revenue without the large budget. However if it shows little to no trend, we will further delve into potential factors that can sell a movie i.e. movie genre.\n",

    "The potential pitfalls of our data is if there is not enough data to calculate the gross revenue to illustrate its correlation to movie release date. This will be a potential confound because it will interfere with discovering our result. This can also influence our interpretations because it can give an inaccurate trend of generated movie revenue. An even greater potential pitfall is if there is not enough data to decipher a trend. The methods pose potential pitfalls if there is not enough data because they will present possibly skewed results."
